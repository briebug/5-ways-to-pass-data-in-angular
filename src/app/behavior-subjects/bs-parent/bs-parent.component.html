<h2>BehaviorSubjects in services</h2>
<p>BehaviorSubjects in services are a simple, powerful way to share data throughout your app. They are as close to <em>$broadcast</em> and <em>$emit</em> in AngularJS as it gets in Angular. The Observable pattern allows you to react to changes whenever they occur in parent and child component alike, while maintaining a single instance.</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>In this demo, we have found a way to manipulate the price of Bitcoin ðŸ˜‰. Enter in the amount you want it to change (negative or positive) from either the parent or child component and the value is updated everywhere.</p>
<p>Change the value of BTC from the parent component:
  <input [formControl]="amount" type="text" class="inline-input" placeholder="enter amount">
  <button type="button" (click)="changeAmount()">Change</button>
  <strong> {{ service.bitcoinValueSubject | async | currency }}</strong>
</p>

<app-bs-child class="child"></app-bs-child>
